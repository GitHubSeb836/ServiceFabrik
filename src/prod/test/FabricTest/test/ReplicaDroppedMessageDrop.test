#Create Service
#FM will add primary on 20
#FM will addReplica to 20 for 10
#20 will send CreateReplica to 10
#10 should fault transient and then report fault permanent
#this will cause the replica id to be bumped up
#10 should then send a replica dropped to the FM
#so that FM can update its replica id and try to add a higher instance replica id
#block this replica dropped
#wait for the create to be retried
#that should not clear the replica dropped pending flag

#block the reopen because after the first createreplica does a replica open
#which fails with report fault transient
